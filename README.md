# Hotel Booking Demand Dataset
The purpose of this project is to predict hotel booking cancellations using classification models (logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM), and to predict average daily rate (ADR) using an ARIMA model. The dataset used for this project is the hotel booking demand dataset provided by Antonio, Almeida and Nunes (2019).

### Project Overview:
    1. Data Preprocessing:
        - Cleaning and transforming raw data.
        - Handling missing values and outliers.

    2. Data Visualisation:
        - Visualising key variables to understand distributions and relationships.
        - Using Plolty in create interactive graphs/charts/plots.

    3. Classification Models:
        - Developed three different classification models—logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine—to predict whether a hotel booking will be cancelled or not.
        - Evaluating and comparing the performance of the three models.

    4. Time Series Forecasting:
        - Building an ARIMA model to forecast future Average Daily Rate (ADR) based on historical ADR data.
        - Evaluating the performance of the ARIMA model.
