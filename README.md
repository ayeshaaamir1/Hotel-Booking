# Hotel Booking Demand Dataset
This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on data pre-processing, visualisation, classification modelling, and time series forecasting. The dataset used for this project is the hotel booking demand dataset provided by Antonio, Almeida and Nunes (2019).

### Project Overview:
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Cleaning and transforming raw data.
    - Handling missing values and outliers.

2. Data Visualisation:
   - Visualising key variables to understand distributions and relationships.
   - Using Plolty in create interactive graphs/charts/plots.

3. Classification Models:
   - Developed three different classification models—logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine—to predict whether a hotel booking will be cancelled or not.
   - Evaluating and comparing the performance of the three models.

4. Time Series Forecasting:
    - Building an ARIMA model to forecast future Average Daily Rate (ADR) based on historical ADR data.
    - Evaluating the performance of the ARIMA model.
